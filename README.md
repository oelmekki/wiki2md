## Why?

I use that to keep local copies on my favorite wikis as markdown files,
since I've already implemented support for markdown in my browser and I'm
familiar with reading the format in plain text. Probably an edge case, but
hey, if you need to convert wiki markup to markdown, it's here. There's a
FOSS project for thatâ„¢.

## Dependencies

* make
* gcc (you can use an other compatible compiler using the `CC` env variable)

## Installation

To install it:

```shell
make                          # the binary is in ./wiki2md
make install                  # install in /usr/local/bin
make install PREFIX=~/bin     # if you want to install somewhere else
```

## Usage

wiki2md file.wiki > file.md
```
